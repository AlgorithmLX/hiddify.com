# Installing HiddifyManager using Docker
An alternative to direct installation on the server is using the Docker version.  

In this version, everything is done automatically. There's no need to install Docker manually, as the script will handle that for you.  

To proceed, simply run the following commands:  

- **Stable version:**  
```
bash <(curl https://i.hiddify.com/docker/latest)
```  

- **Beta version:**  
```
bash <(curl https://i.hiddify.com/docker/beta)
```  

- **Development version:**  
```
bash <(curl https://i.hiddify.com/docker/dev)
```  

- **Specific version:**  
```
bash <(curl https://i.hiddify.com/docker/v10.80.0)
```  

Please note that Docker support is still experimental and may have some issues. If you encounter any, kindly let us know in the comments.  

Finally, you need to configure the domain. Click on [this link](/fa/manager/installation-and-setup/Guide-for-setting-up-the-domain-and-finalizing-the-installation/) to finalize the installation.
