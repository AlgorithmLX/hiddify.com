# Quick installation on Ubuntu

## Before installation

- If you have important information or an important service, note that installing this configuration may interfere with your other services. Therefore, please do not install any special service on your server.
- It is strongly recommended that **Hiddify only be deployed on a single-use host**. Hiddify's deployment model assumes that the host is dedicated solely to running Hiddify and is not shared with other applications or users. Hiddify is not secure in a multi-user environment and that the server should be treated as a dedicated proxy host. We are working in making it proper for multi-user environment and also provide a docker image.

- This code is only applicable on Ubuntu and has been tested only on version 22.04.


- If not, you need a series of prerequisites which you can read them [here](/manager/installation-and-setup/Installation-prerequisites/).
