To download this app, go to [here](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-core/releases) and download the file related to your processor.

## Execution of config or subscription link in HiddifyCli

To use it, the following command should be used.
<div dir="ltr" markdown="1">
  
```
HiddifyCli run -c <config file or sublink> -h <HiddifyApp config file or URL>
```
</div>

- To connect to a specific configuration, just run the above command as follows.
<div dir="ltr" markdown="1">

```
HiddifyCli run -c <config file>
```
</div>

Here, put your desired configuration instead of `<config file>`.

- You can also run a subscription in the app.
<div dir="ltr" markdown="1">
  
```
HiddifyCli run -c <sublink>
```
</div>

Put your subscription link here instead of `<sublink>`.

### Run config or subscription link in HiddifyCli with settings extracted from HiddifyApp
- Also, if you want to use your HDIFYAP settings, you should use the following command.
<div dir="ltr" markdown="1">
  
```
HiddifyCli run -c <config file or sublink> -d <HiddifyApp config file>
```
</div>

Here, put your config file or sublink instead of `<config file or sublink>` and enter the configuration file related to HiddifyApp that you extracted in the previous step instead of `<HiddifyApp config file>`.

- Instead of the config file, you can use the link related to the settings in HiddifyApp that you put on Github.
<div dir="ltr" markdown="1">
  
```
HiddifyCli run -c <config file or sublink> -d <HiddifyApp config URL>
```
</div>

Here, put your config file or sublink instead of `<config file or sublink>` and put the link of the desired settings in HiddifyApp instead of `<HiddifyApp config URL>`.
