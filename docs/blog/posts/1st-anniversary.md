# One-Year Anniversary of Hiddify

## The Story of Hiddify…

Hello to all Hiddify supporters,

Around this time last year, we were all in shock, and everyone was trying to help in any way they could.

Many of our loved ones gave their lives, and their absence will always be felt in our hearts.

Many lost their eyesight, others were fired, some were imprisoned, and more…

All of this happened as part of protests for their natural rights.

These events will never be erased from our minds and will always bring pain to our hearts.

It was during these difficult days last year that we decided to do what we could by providing simple access to the internet, making it easier for the dear people of our country. That was the beginning of this project, and Hiddify was born during these very days.

In the first days, we tried to review various censorship methods and create a list of VPS providers.

After that, we created extremely easy and free installations for Microsoft Azure.

We expanded the project to other datacenters, including quick installations for Hetzner, Oracle Cloud, and OVH. The goal was for everyone to be able to set up their own server without any technical knowledge.

Then, we developed the initial version of the Hiddify server and tried to teach the activation process for the client in a simple way. We also worked to ensure that the server app was resistant to VPN detection bots, obtained valid certificates, set safety configurations, and applied appropriate settings.

As time passed and the internet situation remained dire, we worked harder to simplify complex concepts to make them accessible to everyone. Additionally, we made many articles and tutorial videos available so that everyone could perform complex configurations.

On the client side, existing apps were not as user-friendly as they should have been. Our parents, for example, couldn’t connect with them at all.

To address this, we first created custom versions of Hiddify Clash for Android and desktop to make the user connection process easier.

Gradually, your support for the project grew, and this provided extra motivation to add more features to the panel. We developed the multi-user version of the panel, redesigned many components, improved structures, and set up a support group on Telegram.

On the client side, after developing several versions of the Hiddify Clash app, many bugs in the Clash Meta core led us to seek an alternative solution.

After thoroughly reviewing and redesigning the entire client process based on performance tests, we decided to use the best market solutions. This led to the birth of the custom HiddifyNG and HiddifyN versions, which were warmly welcomed by you all.

For example, HiddifyNG was downloaded more than 100,000 times on Google Play and received a 4.8 out of 5 rating from you, which is incredible for an app less than five months old.

At the same time, on the server side, we added new protocols and introduced more features, including automatic CDN IP selection, simultaneous use of multiple domains, adding intermediate nodes, and many other features that cannot all be mentioned here.

### One-Year Anniversary of Hiddify
On our first anniversary:

On the client side, we introduced the cross-platform HiddifyNext app for Android, Windows, Linux, and Mac, and we will soon release it for iOS as well.

Our goal was to make it easy for developers to implement new protocols across all operating systems and to maintain integration across platforms.

The new app design is simple, performs efficiently, and uses minimal system resources. We will continue to add more exciting new features to it.

If you are a panel developer, you can read here how to integrate your panel with the app.

On the server side, in addition to previous protocols like Vless, Vmess, and Trojan, we introduced newer protocols such as Reality gRPC, WebSocket, H2, and SSH. In the panel’s beta version, protocols like Hysteria2 and TUICv5 with unified user management are now available and can easily be accessed in the beta version. They will be officially released soon.

If you would like to test the beta version and use the newer protocols, you can find out how to upgrade to the beta here. The next stable panel release will be the most bug-free and fastest version yet, so it will remain in beta for a longer period.

Everything that has been done so far has been spontaneous, voluntary, and without any financial gain. All the donations from you have gone toward the project and will continue to do so.

Through this difficult journey, we sincerely thank everyone who has helped us in any way to ensure that the dear people of our country remain connected to the free internet and can emerge from this absolute darkness.

We are also grateful to everyone who has fought for the internet for all.

To all of you who have continuously supported and stood by us on this journey, we are deeply thankful.

We hope for a day when no one is oppressed or controlled by authoritarian regimes.

Hiddify, for a free internet.
